This is problematic for various reasons:


	The process has become too product-focused, driven by the drafting of Humanitarian NeedsOverview (HNO) and Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) documents that eventually enable theproduction of the annual Global Humanitarian Overview (GHO), which is important to fund-raising efforts.
	It is resource-intensive, requiring significant staff time from OCHA and partners.
	It results in a snapshot of needs and response priorities that become often quickly out of date, asthe situation evolves.


More regular updates of humanitarian needs and response progress and gaps should help address these issues by consolidating and analysing information and data throughout the year, as required, with the aim to inform more timely and relevant response decisions by the Humanitarian Country Team (HCT). There is nothing new in this concept, as monitoring has been an integral part of the HPC since its inception with the Transformative Agenda in 2011. However, its implementation has proven elusive, including because of the heavy focus on the yearly HNO and HRP outputs.

Multi-year planning of humanitarian response is already being increasingly adopted to encourage more sustainable results and, where possible, facilitate the transition between short and longer term programmes and eventually reduce the former. Few of these multi-year humanitarian plans have been based on a solid analysis that builds on past trends and brings in contextual information typically found in development analyses. Experiences with joint analysis between humanitarian and development actors are not documented, thus limiting lesson learning.

This provisional guidance note is an attempt to assist OCHA Country Offices with facilitating and supporting joint analysis between humanitarian and development actors when appropriate. Reflecting the paucity of concrete examples of practical ways to arrange for and undertake joint analysis, the guidance is admittedly still conceptual rather than grounded in proven experience, but is an attempt to suggest workable steps that can be applied and adapted to each field context.

Multi-Year Humanitarian Planning (MYP) Tip Sheet for OCHA Country/Regional Offices,,,https://assessments.hpc.tools/sites/default/files/km/myhrp_tip_sheet_update_13_nov_2018.pdf,Guidance,,"Response Analysis and Planning, Multi-year planning and nexus (joint-up planning and collective outcomes)",,,2018-11-13T00:00:00,,2019-04-17,Yes,2019-04-17,"A multi-year HRP (MYP) can be used for planning and coordinating the delivery of humanitarian aid in protracted crises. It differs from a traditional HRP in its focus on establishing a response strategy beyond one year. A MYP can facilitate a more effective humanitarian response through more predictable and realistic/appropriate operational arrangements and a greater focus on the sustainability of results. It also ensures enhanced complementarity with development assistance and other frameworks.

A MYP takes into account the impact that humanitarian and development assistance are expected to have over time in contexts where crises are likely to continue over the medium to long term, or in contexts where there is a clear scope to accelerate the exit from humanitarian assistance by planning on a longer timeframe. In order to be successful, a multi-year HRP requires development action to be at-scale and target the most vulnerable people down to the local level. This would contribute to breaking the cycle of humanitarian dependence and allow for a phased transfer of caseloads, whenever appropriate, from the multi-year HRP to development planning frameworks, such as the UNDAF. In many cases, this requires more risk tolerance, earlier engagement, and more flexible and context-adaptable programming by development actors. It may also require the MYP to clarify steps that will be taken to ensure a boost in development action (e.g. advocacy, capacity building, etc).

Multi-year planning does not solicit humanitarian partners to get involved in the implementation of development plans or programmes. It encourages them to collaborate more effectively with development and other partners at the analysis and planning stages, and to advocate for development partners’ earlier or staggered engagement in crisis contexts, to address the structural and chronic causes of humanitarian needs. Given longer decision and implementation cycles for development programming, a MYP also offers development actors a longer time window within which to interact with humanitarian programming processes and, where possible, adapt development programming over time.

In 2018, in recognition of the impetus from the Grand Bargain, REACH initiated and technically led, in close consultation with OCHA and UNHCR (in refugee contexts), 8 Multi-sector Needs Assessments in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, Nigeria, Uganda, Ukraine, Somalia and Yemen. This review found that these multi sector needs assessments (MSNAs) are gaining acceptance and increasingly mainstreamed as a tool to bolster the evidence base of consolidated planning and appeal processes such as the Humanitarian Needs Overviews (HNO) and Humanitarian Response Plans (HRP).

The result of this work is a set of revised HPC templates with associated Step-by-Step guide. These serve to update existing guidance, integrating developments achieved over recent years on needs assessment and response planning, as well as commitments made at the World Humanitarian Summit and Grand Bargain. The Step-by-Step guide also provides important information on sequencing to ensure appropriate linkages between HNOs, HRPs and ongoing monitoring of the situation, needs and results.

They are frequently neglected, stigmatized, and may face difficulties in accessing health services that are otherwise available to the general population. In the context of this Interim Guidance, the people in humanitarian situations affected by this guidance may include internally displaced persons (IDPs), host communities, asylum seekers, refugees and returnees, and migrants when in similar situations. While further adaptations might be needed for some population groups, including those living in slums this interim guidance is issued to assist field staff to immediately respond to urgent needs,

It is of extreme importance from a protection, human-rights and public health perspectives, that people affected by humanitarian crises are included in all COVID-19 outbreak readiness and response strategies, plan and operations. There is a strong public health rationale to extend all measures to everyone, regardless of status and ensuring inclusiveness.
